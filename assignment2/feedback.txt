Great Job Renee, here are some notes below:

-  Question to think about, what if we had 100 folders instead of 3? What would you do differently?

-  Great job using ng-value for the folder radio buttons.

-  I did the todo's a little differently, but I see where you're going with it.  I never thought about it like that :).  Good job.

Overall, great job!
