Great job Renee.  These are all really minor notes but they're mostly around simplification.  Here they are:

- this is small, but to save a step when creating a new assignment instead of 

	var objAssignment = {};
	objAssignment.assignment = name;
	objAssignment.score = score;

	you can just do...

	var objAssignment = {
		assignment: name,
		score: score
	};

- instead of keeping a variable for the number of assignments you can just use the length of the array.  So...

	return allScores/arrOfAssignments.length;



- for the calcGrade function you don't need to check if it's less then the previous thing...

	eg:

		if(average <= 100 && average>=90){
			return "A";
		}else if(average < 90 && average>=80){
			return "B";
		}else if(average < 80 && average>=70){
			return "C";
		}else if(average < 70 && average>=60){
			return "D";
		}else{
			return "F";
		}

	the else part takes care of that.  Eg if it's less than 90 it will go to the second block, so you can just say

		if(average>=90){
			return "A";
		}else if(average>=80){
			return "B";
		}else if(average>=70){
			return "C";
		}else if(average>=60){
			return "D";
		}else{
			return "F";
		}

- that's all I have really it looks great.  :)
